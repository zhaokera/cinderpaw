## Overview

This epic implements player ability unlocks, runtime activation gates,
cooldowns, and ability-driven presentation hooks. It starts by making Rat King's
`dash` reward consumable by the playable Cinderpaw controller instead of only
recording the reward in progression state.

## Governing ADRs

| ADR | Decision Summary | Engine Risk |
|-----|------------------|-------------|
| ADR-0001: Autoload architecture | Ability state lives on scene/entity components, not a new Autoload. | LOW |
| ADR-0003: Data management | Ability registry data is JSON source data loaded through DataManager. | LOW |
| ADR-0005: Combat state machine | Ability activation must respect combat-state blocking rules. | LOW |
| ADR-0018: Player abilities | AbilityComponent owns unlocks, cooldowns, activation checks, and signals. | LOW |
| ADR-0021: Save system | Runtime progression and unlocked abilities persist through save snapshots. | LOW |

## GDD Requirements

| TR-ID | Requirement | ADR Coverage |
|-------|-------------|--------------|
| TR-ability-001 | Ability registry contains eight core abilities with initial and boss-based unlocks. | ADR-0003, ADR-0018 |
| TR-ability-002 | Runtime queries expose `has_ability`, `get_unlocked_abilities`, `is_ability_on_cooldown`, `unlock_ability`, and `reset_air_abilities`. | ADR-0018 |
| TR-ability-003 | Abilities use different cooldowns: dodge 0.5s, dash 1.0s, parry 0.3s, double jump air-count reset. | ADR-0018 |
| TR-ability-004 | Ability activation follows input, unlock, cooldown, prerequisite, activation/event, cooldown-start order. | ADR-0018 |
| TR-ability-005 | Ability unlocks emit events for presentation, gates, HUD, and save recording. | ADR-0002, ADR-0018, ADR-0021 |
| TR-ability-006 | Skill-tree modifiers can adjust ability parameters. | ADR-0018 |

## Stories

| # | Story | Type | Status | ADR |
|---|-------|------|--------|-----|
| 001 | Dash Runtime Ability Gate | Integration + Gameplay Runtime + Visual | Complete | ADR-0003/0005/0018/0021 |

## Definition of Done

This epic is complete when:

- Ability registry data loads through DataManager and validates through schema.
- `AbilityComponent` is mounted under Player and exposes all GDD query and
  activation APIs.
- Initial abilities are available at game start and boss rewards unlock later
  abilities exactly once.
- Dash, double jump, aerial attack, wall climb, parry, and future ability
  consumers are connected to gameplay input/presentation as their stories land.
- Player-visible 2D ability states use `AnimatedSprite2D` + `SpriteFrames` and
  pass MCP runtime checks.
- Logic and integration stories have passing focused tests plus risk-appropriate
  Godot MCP evidence.

## Next Step

Story001 is complete. Continue skill-tree spending UI, ExplorationGate
`requires_ability` doors, and later boss-reward ability consumers.
